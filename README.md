# interp

Interp is a Go package for interpolation.

Note that it's still a work in progress and the API is likely to change.

## To Do

* Types
  - Linear
  - Cubic bezier
  - Others?
* APIs: Given interpolation parameters, return:
  - N points
  - An iterator that yields N points
  - A function F(t)
* Construct splines
